# Catch The Pink Flamingo Game

This project was one of the requirements within my postgraduate module called Big Data Management. The main aim of this project is to utilize Classification & Clustering technqiues onto the dataset. The classification model chosen in this project is Naive Bayes and the Clustering model chosen is K-means Clustering. Moreover, a graph analysis is performed using the Neo4j software to identify the relationship between the data.
